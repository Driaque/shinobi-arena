# Fabled Rivals recovery checkpoint

Updated 2026-11-07.

## Scope and authorization

User asked to continue the interrupted Game Logo Design work, apply the remaining original character PNG portraits and arena artwork, save recovery checkpoints going forward, and publish updates only to the existing Render game. Source remains Driaque/shinobi-arena; GitHub Pages must receive no further updates.

## Recovered work

Branch: feat/painted-roster-stages. Recovered asset commit: e6d9f87454a62a56259770d18501d89a8eb15e4b.
Ten original portraits and five stages are already generated, exported and integrated. Do not regenerate them.
Production exports and source metadata: apps/web/assets/painted-v1/manifest.json.
Integration: packages/presentation/artwork.js, roster.js, stage-picker.js, renderer.js and visual-lab-renderers.js.
Local high-resolution masters: /workspace/scratch/dbab2c3e1dc7/art-masters (temporary; production exports are tracked in Git).
Recovered verification: 342 tests and build passed in previous chat; no verified saved browser result.

## Current integration

Merged current main efbd0e9 (controller menu cursor). Retained its v0.38.0 notes and moved artwork to v0.39.0. Retained both cursor CSS and painted portrait CSS. Removed Pages deploy workflow; release publishing now waits for Deploy Render.

## Current verification and blocker

Resume integration commit: 962770d6a430b6ff7ff4dcc15e919f5151ce0c3e.
Fresh npm run verify passed: 345 tests, zero failures, syntax/release checks and v0.39.0 build. Portrait contact sheet visually inspected.
Browser verification is incomplete: Playwright Chromium download returned truncated/non-ZIP data. The browser suites remain required in hosted CI before merge/deploy.

The attempt to push feat/painted-roster-stages was blocked by automatic approval review. It interpreted the user instruction “not Driaque/shinobi arena” as forbidding source updates to Driaque/shinobi-arena as well as Pages publication. Do not retry through another route. Ask whether GitHub source pushes are allowed solely to feed the existing Render deployment, with Pages publishing removed.

## Next steps

After explicit clarification authorizing source pushes: push branch, create PR, complete hosted CI/browser checks, merge when passing, monitor Deploy Render, verify /health version and exact commit, confirm matching GitHub Release, record PR/deploy IDs here. No deployment has occurred in this resumed session.

## Limits

Painted portraits and flattened arena scenery do not replace combat fighter animations or add collision geometry/parallax layers.
